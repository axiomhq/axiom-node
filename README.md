[Axiom](https://axiom.co) unlocks observability at any scale.

- **Ingest with ease, store without limits:** Axiom’s next-generation datastore enables ingesting petabytes of data with ultimate efficiency. Ship logs from Kubernetes, AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, DigitalOcean, Nomad, and others.
- **Query everything, all the time:** Whether DevOps, SecOps, or EverythingOps, query all your data no matter its age. No provisioning, no moving data from cold/archive to “hot”, and no worrying about slow queries. All your data, all. the. time.
- **Powerful dashboards, for continuous observability:** Build dashboards to collect related queries and present information that’s quick and easy to digest for you and your team. Dashboards can be kept private or shared with others, and are the perfect way to bring together data from different sources

For more information check out the [official documentation](https://axiom.co/docs).

## Usage

Install using `npm install`:

```shell
npm install @axiomhq/axiom-node
```

If you use the [Axiom CLI](https://github.com/axiomhq/cli), run `eval $(axiom config export -f)` to configure your environment variables.

Otherwise create a personal token in [the Axiom settings](https://cloud.axiom.co/settings/profile) and export it as `AXIOM_TOKEN`. Set `AXIOM_ORG_ID` to the organization ID from the settings page of the organization you want to access.

Create and use a client like this:

```ts
import Client from '@axiomhq/axiom-node';

const client = new Client();

await client.datasets.ingestEvents('my-dataset', [
  { 'foo': 'bar'},
]);

const res = await client.datasets.query(`['my-dataset'] | where foo == 'bar' | limit 100`);
```
